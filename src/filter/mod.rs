//! Filtering the index (PRD §9.3): which entries pass every active filter, and the
//! level counters of the header (PRD §7.1).
//!
//! The filters combine with AND. An [`Engine`] evaluates them on a background
//! thread, a chunk of entries at a time, and publishes what it found after each
//! chunk. Setting new filters starts a new generation and cancels the one running.
//! Entries appended to the index are evaluated as they come, and an entry the index
//! read again is evaluated again.
//!
//! The level, time and class checks read the record and the class column of the
//! entry's first line; only the text check reads the rest of the entry. An engine
//! can also count a search: it then passes the entries that pass the filters and
//! have a line the search matches.
