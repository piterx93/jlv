///
/// The follow status is ` ─ READ-ONLY ○` for a gzip file, which is never followed,
/// then ` ─ truncated .gz` if it ended early or was corrupt ([`App::origin`]). For a
/// plain file it is ` ─ WAITING FOR FILE ○` while the file is gone from its path,
/// otherwise ` ─ FOLLOW ` and the dot while the app follows the file,
/// ` ─ PAUSED +N new ` and the dot while it doesn't and N new entries came in
/// ([`App::new_entries`]), and ` ─ PAUSED ` and the dot while it doesn't and none
/// came. The dot shows the file's [liveness](App::liveness): `●` while it is live,
/// `◐` while it is quiet and `○` while it is idle. Its cell keeps the header's bold
/// reverse video with a green, yellow or dark gray background, so that it shows in
/// that colour on the bar; under the plain theme the shape alone tells them apart.
///
/// The row that marks a truncation shows `── file truncated ──` after the gutter.
///
/// Under `Raw` a row is the entry's first line. Under the other presets it is a table
/// row, columns separated by a space: the timestamp in the app's zone
/// (the configured format, `%H:%M:%S%.3f` below 100 columns), the level (5 wide,
/// in the style of [`App::colors`]), the thread if shown (15 wide, a longer name keeps
/// its end after `…`), the class abbreviated to fit (30% of the width, from 24 to 40 columns,
/// cut with `…` if even the abbreviation is too wide) and the message in the rest.
/// The headless entry has only a message, its first line. A folded entry's message
/// ends with ` [+N]`, N being the lines it hides; an unfolded entry's continuation
/// lines are rows of their own, in the message column. Messages are cut at the
/// right edge, or wrapped onto the following lines of the message column; scrolled
/// right, they stop once the longest message on screen ends at the right edge.
/// The lines in between follow the frame's height, so this resizes `app`.
///
/// Below 80×24 the lines are replaced by `terminal too small (80×24 needed)` and `app`
/// keeps its size, so a briefly small terminal doesn't move the view. They are
/// replaced by `no entries match the current filters` once the filters' results are
/// in and no entry passes ([`App::nothing_matches`]).
///
/// While the level panel ([`App::panel`]) is open it is drawn over the middle of
/// the body, a box 16 columns wide and 8 high titled ` Levels `: one line per level,
/// TRACE to FATAL, as ` ▶[x] 1 TRACE ` (`▶` on the cursor's line, `[ ]` for a level
/// the panel hides, then the key that toggles it and the name). The footer then
/// shows the panel's keys, `j/k Move  Space/1-6 Toggle  Enter Apply  Esc Cancel`.
///
/// The class panel is drawn the same way, a box 44 columns wide and 10 high titled
/// ` Classes `: one line per rule line of the panel, as ` ▶com.myco.*` (`▶` on the
/// cursor's line). The footer then shows `↑/↓ Line (↓ at the end adds one)  Enter
/// Apply  Esc Cancel`, or, while the panel has an [error](crate::app::ClassPanel::error),
/// why its rules don't parse.
///
/// The time panel is drawn the same way, a box 40 columns wide and 4 high titled
/// ` Time `: the spec as typed, as ` ▶10m`, and below it the filter it makes, as
/// `  last 10m (file)`, blank while it makes none. The footer then shows `↑/↓
/// Preset  Tab File/now  Enter Apply  Esc Cancel`, or the panel's
/// [error](crate::app::TimePanel::error).
///
/// The text filter prompt is drawn the same way, a box 60 columns wide and 4 high
/// titled ` Text filter `: the pattern as typed, as ` ▶time.*out`, and below it the
/// options, as `  [x] regex  [ ] ignore case`. The footer then shows `Ctrl-r Regex
/// Tab Ignore case  Enter Apply  Esc Cancel`, or the prompt's
/// [error](crate::app::Prompt::error).
///
/// The search prompt is drawn the same way, titled ` Search ` or ` Search backward `,
/// with the footer `Ctrl-r Regex  Tab Ignore case  Enter Search  Esc Cancel`.
///
/// While a jump prompt is open, the footer shows it in place of the key hints: `:`
/// and the text typed for a line, `t ` and the text for a time, followed by ` ─ `
/// and the prompt's [error](crate::app::JumpPrompt::error) while it has one.
///
/// The export prompt is shown the same way, as `export to: ` and the path typed,
/// or, while it [asks to overwrite](crate::app::ExportPrompt::overwrite),
/// `overwrite <path>? y/n`.
///
/// While the help overlay is open, it is drawn the same way, a box titled ` Help `,
/// as wide as its widest line and the border need (the widest keys and the widest
/// description plus 5 columns) and as high as its lines and the border need, but no
/// wider and no higher than the body: one line per line of [`Keymap::help`](crate::keymap::Keymap::help), from the first
/// that [`HelpPanel::scroll`](crate::app::HelpPanel::scroll) leaves, as ` k ↑
/// Move up`: a space, the keys left-aligned in a column as wide as the widest keys,
/// two spaces and the description. It tells the app how many lines it shows
/// ([`App::fit_help`]). The footer then shows `j/k Scroll  PgUp/PgDn Page
/// F1/Esc/q Close`.
///
/// While the app [shows the details pane](App::shows_details), the bottom of the
/// body is a box titled ` Details `, a third of the screen's height high (at least 5
/// lines, and at most what leaves the rows 5), with a plain border (`┌─┐`), or a thick
/// one (`┏━┓`) while it has the [focus](App::focus). Inside, one column in from each
/// side, it shows the selected entry ([`App::details_entry`]): under a preset, a
/// first line with the full class and the thread in parentheses, as
/// `com.example.App (main)`, then the message of the entry's first line, then every
/// continuation line; the headless entry, and every entry under `Raw`, show their
/// lines as they are. Lines are made safe to show like the rows and wrapped at the
/// box's inner width, cut at the column rather than at a word. The pane is scrolled as
/// [`App::details_scroll`] says, and tells the app its inner height and how many
/// wrapped lines the entry takes ([`App::fit_details`]).
///
/// While the app [shows the histogram](App::shows_histogram) and has one, the line
/// below the filter bar, or below the header without one, is the histogram row, taken
/// from the body. Its first columns, all but the last 20, show the histogram
/// ([`App::histogram`] for that many columns), one column per bucket from the left:
/// blank for a bucket without entries, otherwise one of `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` for its count in
/// eighths of the largest count, rounded up, so that the largest gets `█` and every
/// other bucket with an entry at least `▁`. Right-aligned at the end of the line is
/// the largest count and the bucket size, as `max 9/5m` (sizes as `1s`, `10m`, `6h`,
/// `1d`, and merged days as `37d`). While the histogram has the [focus](App::focus),
/// the selected bucket ([`App::histogram_bucket`]) is in reverse video and the end of
/// the line is its count and its start in the app's zone, as `1 at 10:10:00`, or as
/// `1 at 2026-10-07` for buckets of a day or more. Below 80×24 there is no histogram
/// row.
///
/// While the app has a search, the header has ` ─ match k/N` ([`App::match_count`])
/// after the status and before the notice.
///
/// While the app has a [notice](App::notice), the header ends with ` ─ ` and it.
/// The level counters ([`App::level_counts`]) are right-aligned on the header line,
/// FATAL to TRACE as `F:1 E:37 W:212 I:5000 D:12 T:3`, levels with no entries left
/// out. The title comes first: the counters only get the columns it leaves after a
/// space, and are left out entirely when they don't fit there.
///
/// While a filter is active, the line below the header is the filter bar, taken from
/// the body: `Filters: ` and the active filters two spaces apart, in this order,
/// `level[W E F]` (the first letters of the levels shown), `class[com.myco.*
/// !org.hibernate]` (the class rules), `time[last 10m (file)]` (the time filter) and
/// `text[timeout]` (the pattern; `text[time.*out (regex, ignore case)]` with the
/// options that are on). Without filters there is no bar.
