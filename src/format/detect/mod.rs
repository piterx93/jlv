/// once ANSI escape codes are stripped; no line past it is read. Blank lines don't
/// count toward the 200, but at most 2000 lines are read in all, so a file of blank
/// lines isn't read to its end. Continuation lines in the sample, those that start
/// with a space or a tab or are an exception line (see [`is_exception_line`]), are
/// left out. Each format in [`BUILT_IN`](super::BUILT_IN) but `raw` scores the share
/// of the remaining lines that start an entry in it. The best score wins if it is at
/// least 60%, ties going to the format that comes first in the table. Otherwise, and
/// when no line remains, it is `None`.
